If you want, I can also add:

    a tiny Rust “tamper check” function that validates the ASAR integrity hash,

    a build script that copies the correct .dll/.so/.dylib into resources/native/,

    and a GitHub Actions pipeline that produces signed artifacts.


Yes. For a robust model:

    Server: issues short-lived tokens (Ed25519 signed).

    Client (Rust): verifies signature (verify_token), checks expiry (validate_expiry), enforces HWID binding by comparing payload’s device_id to native get_hwid() (you can add that check either in JS after decodePayload or add a native validate_binding(token) export; I can add it if you prefer all-native).

    At rest: store encrypted token using device-derived key (encrypt_token).

    Online: roll tokens regularly (/heartbeat), revoke on server, short offline window.
